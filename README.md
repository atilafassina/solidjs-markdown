## Setup

To have auth working, you will need a [Xata](https://xata.io) account and initialize a database:

```
pnpx @xata.io/cli@latest init schema=schema-template.json
```

This will create a database at Xata with the schema in the `json`, it will also add the `XATA_API_KEY` to your `.env` and create a `.xatarc` with your database url.

## Ready to go

Now it's a matter of installing rest of dependencies and running the dev server.

```
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

## Deploy?

Soon. There is some refactoring happening at SolidStart right now which will affect the adapters, so let's wait.
